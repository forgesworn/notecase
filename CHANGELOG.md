# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

Initial implementation.

- The wallet engine: receive-and-rotate, exact-amount preparation
  (split/merge in one request), send with reclaim, melt to invoice,
  Lightning Address or NWC, mint with NWC-paid or manually paid invoices.
- Engine surface for frontends: `sentNotes`/`reclaim`/`markTaken`,
  `rotateLive` (panic rotate), `setDefaultMint`, guarded `removeMint`,
  and passphrase-sealed portable backups (`exportBackup`/`importBackup`,
  PBKDF2 600k - never the device PIN).
- The web wallet grew into a full product: welcome + restore onboarding,
  camera QR scanning with a universal classify-on-scan button, per-note
  detail with verified-signature badge and panic rotate, handed-over
  notes reclaimable until taken, history, mint management with per-mint
  balances and suggested mints, fee-grossed mint amounts, presets and
  Max, tap-to-reveal bearer QRs, system share, a `#/claim` fragment
  route, and an installable PWA that asks before updating and never
  caches a protocol call.
- Crash-safe staging: secrets persisted before disclosure, ambiguity as a
  first-class state, reconcile() resolving every parked outcome by
  probing - including the rotate probe that distinguishes a restored melt
  from a pending one.
- PIN-locked store via keystore-kit over an encrypted file; Shamir word
  shares of the store key via shamir-words.
- NWC integration via nwc-kit with preimage-verified payments.
- DNS-pinned outbound fetch via farrier-kit, loopback passthrough for
  local mints.
- Tested against the conformance mock mint's misbehaviour matrix, a fake
  NIP-47 wallet service running the real ceremony, and moneyer end to end.
